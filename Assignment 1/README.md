# Socket Programming and Packet Analysis

In this assignment, an experiment was conducted to study the basic concepts of `Socket Programming`using a communication channel between the client and server using the TCP protocol and `Packet Analysis` performed with Wireshark.

## Socket Programming

The [server.c](./Scripts/server.c) and [client.c](./Scripts/client.c) programs demonstrate a simple client-server architecture implemented using socket programming in C. The server acts as a centralized communication hub, waiting for client connections and responding to their requests, while the client initiates a connection, sends messages, and receives responses. Both programs rely on the `TCP protocol`, ensuring reliable data transmission between the two endpoints.
